# "This shall pass"






Hey,

Have you ever had a situation in your life where you're exhausted and tired and want to give up?

It could be during exam season, or you're on a deadline, or maybe you're dealing with a rough time in your relationship.

I am sure that all of us have had those moments–the moments when we just want to give up.

In this article, I wanted to talk about how to muster up the courage to keep going when you are at a low in your life.

When I have such moments, I remember "_this shall pass._"

It is a very simple concept yet not very obvious.

The reason it helps me is because when I remember that, I know that this will end. I won't have to grind this hard forever.

Last year when I was in grade 12 and was leading a team of 8 members constantly trying to do something greater, studying and doing assignments, living on my own, cooking, cleaning, trying to make a sustainable side hustle income and everything else, there were times when I would almost burnout or get super stressed.

The only thing that helped me keep going during those times were the fact that it was temporary.

I knew I wouldn't have to be stressed about the next assignment deadline or organizing the next event throughout my life.

I knew it would end, and I would be less stressed.

Even during the end of 2023, when I was trying to complete Harvard's 11-week-long [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) course within 2 weeks, I was like "I don't want to do this, it's so hard."

But then I thought: "Once I complete this, that's it. I won't have to stress about it again. It will pass."

And I completed CS50 and also built a cool Chrome extension ([video demo](https://youtu.be/F6LZ3om_k1o?si=IvbcR3sXTG3-gOhu)) as my final project for Harvard's CS50.

It passed.

**Lesson:** When you're having a hard time, know that it will pass. Whether it be a crisis, a project, a low in your relationship, whatever it be, _it shall pass_.

If you read the entire article and found it helpful, do let me know via the comments.

I'd really appreciate it.
