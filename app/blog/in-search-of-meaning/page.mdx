# In search of meaning






Dear reader,

I am at a point in life where I'm struggling to find meaning in things. By things, I mean almost everything. I know for certain, as do you, that this is a season, a season that comes and goes. It will, in due time, pass, and I will begin to find meaning in things again. But while I'm here, in this season of meaninglessness, there is an idea I'd like to share.

A little over a year back, I shared my thoughts on nihilism in an [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7sbfMsvA79/). Although some time has passed since then, I have yet to be able to find a solid argument against nihilism. Seriously, what even is the point in anything if I know for certain that at some point in not so distant future, I'm not going to be here anymore? What even is the point in anything if in less than 200 years, I, everyone I love, everyone they love is going to be dead? If everything is going to end, what even is the point in pursuing meaning?

These same questions were also faced by the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy over a 100 years ago. He had everything a mortal might desire. He had a loving wife, a beautiful family, good health, a home, status, wealth, and what we call "success." Yet, he struggled with meaning. He experienced a profound midlife crisis and severe depression. As he kept looking, though, he noticed something interesting: Almost everyone around him who was religious to any extent didn't have such struggles.

Now, the reason might not necessarily be only the "life after death" that all religions teach, but it could be just faith. Faith teaches that there is a superior power watching us, loving us, looking out for us. This doesn't imply that we wouldn't have difficult times, because we would, we often do. But faith gave meaning to people; it gave meaning and a set of guidelines to be good and do good in the world. More importantly, it gave hope to people.

Although Tolstoy had spent most of his life as a non-religious person, he learned that if he wanted to live a happy, meaningful life, he would have to try to embrace this idea of faith and re-examine his beliefs. And so he did. He gained a personal understanding of Christianity that emphasized love, forgiveness, and a simple life.

It wouldn't have to be Christianity. It could be any religion that you follow because every religion has these fundamental teachings of hope, of being, and doing good. What would be important, however, is diving deeper into your faith.

Now, what if you don't or if you struggle to believe in God? What if "logically" believing in God doesn't make sense to you? If that is the case, my friend, I invite you to watch [this video](https://youtu.be/x6_ESSfyiYE?si=PXUDnmSFRzG5ptMn) on YouTube, which is a compilation of interview clips with Jordan B. Peterson, who is a phenomenal psychologist and author. You don't have to agree with him, but I suggest you at least hear him out.

Back to the season of meaninglessness, I honestly don't know how long this is going to last. Yet I'm hopeful, as I've always been, that something will click, that things will get better, for they always do. Until then, I'll continue to read and study and pray and work.

Until next time, my friend.

Take care.

Warmly,  
Suraj
