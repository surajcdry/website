# The /now movement






Hellooo reader, [Suraj](/https://www.surajc.com) here –

Since the August of 2024, which is almost 9 months and 3 weeks ago, I have been maintaining my [/now](/now) page. It is basically a record of my life at any given time. I update it every month with the recent things that I've done or the things that I'm doing during that month.

But why do I do this? Why do I keep and maintain my /now page?

The benefit is very simple: It is the public declaration of my priorities. It allows me to stay clear about the things that I'm working on. It does not necessarily motivate me to do things, but it definitely inspires me to reflect on things. Often, this reflection leads to action, which then brings positive outcomes in life.

I have made my /now page public, which you can easily check by going to [surajc.com/now](/now), but you don't have to do the same. You could keep a private record of your priorities, and go back to it every now and then to update and seek direction when you feel lost.

This is it for this week. I will see you again next week. Until then, take care my friend.

Warmly,  
Suraj
