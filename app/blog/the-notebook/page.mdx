# The Notebook






Hey reader,

As I continue on with the [LID challenge](/blog/lid-challenge), I've come to realize that multi-purpose devices are a lot harder to use for a singular purpose.

If I open my laptop to add one task to my to-do list, or to glance at my calendar, it's very likely that I'll end up either checking my email or quickly checking if any of the YouTubers I regularly watch have uploaded any newer videos or something.

This realization came in my Psychology class. Until recently, I had been taking notes on my laptop for that class. When our Professor decided to no longer let students use their digital devices, I was forced to begin taking notes in my notebook. Immediately, I realized that I was paying a lot more attention throughout the lecture.

Since I could no longer go to the previous slide whenever I needed to during the lecture, I had to make sure I understood everything on a particular slide right when the Professor displayed it. Hence, more focus (and more questions I asked).

I also began doing one other thing. Whenever I got an idea for something (like this issue) or a task I might need to get done, I could easily note it down without a chance of getting distracted by a notification or an email. Interesting stuff.

So, I've begun carrying a small notebook with me, and for the foreseeable future, I see myself using that notebook actively. On a notebook, I get to make any weird shapes I want or connect ideas roughly. I couldn't type those things. Yes, I could've used an iPad for that but an iPad would (again) come with all the distractions associated with digital technology.

As I become more intentional with myself, I'm realizing that I'm going to a more old-school lifestyle. Reducing social media usage and screen time, using a pen and notebook, and so on and so forth. It's very interesting.

So, here's what I invite you to try: Take a moment to think about the times when you pick up a digital device to do a specific thing. How often do you end up getting distracted by other things it comes with?

Would using a single-utility tool help? Perhaps a notebook for a to-do list/ideas/writing/drawing?

I hope this gives you something interesting to think about over the weekend.

I'll see you next week.

Until then, take care.

Warmly,  
Suraj
