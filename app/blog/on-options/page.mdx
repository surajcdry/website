# On options






Is having options a good or a bad thing? 

Any sensible person would say that it is a good thing because you get to compare and pick the better one. But is it really that simple? Most definitely not. 

[Studies](https://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Iyengar%20%26%20Lepper%20\(2000\).pdf) have shown that having too many options often leads to a person not picking any at all, and also that fewer choices result in more satisfaction. But this issue of Figuring Things Out is not about the difference between having too many or too few options. This issue is about something more nuanced than that. 

A few months ago, I was experimenting with an app called [Detox Lock](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6504188981) on my phone. When I was trying it for the first time, it was a totally free app; now it has a freemium plan. So some features are free, and others are paid. 

The entire concept of the app is to block all the apps on your phone. You, for sure, can choose a few apps to keep. I had chosen Messages and Phone. Other than those, you would not be able to use anything for a certain time. 

When I did it, my phone became unattractive. The app took away my option to scroll through YouTube or browse websites. I could only study on my laptop. Please note that I already have a system on my laptop that blocks everything, especially the browser. That day of the experiment, I was able to get so many things. When I didn’t have many options, when I could either just die of boredom or do the things on my to-do list, the latter seemed more attractive. Hence, I made meaningful progress.

This begs a question: Is this option phenomenon applicable in other parts of our lives as well? 

I’d say yes. When you don’t have options, you learn to make peace with what you have. You begin to embrace it and work with it. When you have the constant option of doing something more stimulating, such as using your phone or watching Netflix, it’s very difficult to choose to do the difficult reading or work on a paper. 

When you have the option to quickly order something on your phone, you’ll probably not choose to cook the healthier, more time-demanding food. When you have the option to exit a marriage or end a relationship, you probably won’t even try to make things better; you’ll just give up. 

I’m not saying that it’s always bad to have options, but what I’m saying is that sometimes, especially when you’re trying to be in control of your life and make progress on important things, it can be useful to think of how to limit the options that take you away from your ideal outcome. 

When the only option you have is to get a job or to build a business and make it successful or build a good life, you will do everything possible to make that happen. That is commitment, that is focus.

I myself am working on this. Being in NYC and being a student has given me a lot of options, too many, I might add. I am working on limiting my options so that I’m able to focus on things that will actually move the needle for me.

I hope this sparks something for you to use.

I will see you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
