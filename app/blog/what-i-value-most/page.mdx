# What I value most






Dear reader, [Suraj](/) here —

A little over a year ago, I wrote in an Instagram post about my [dilemma of two personas](https://www.instagram.com/surajcdry/p/C5GWD9FPOUb_78dzDy0xxRvOkhYRv9YkwGmK4k0/). The dilemma was between focusing primarily on career/success/freedom vs. living a slower life. Now, I think I have more clarity on what I want to pursue.

> It is: a loving family and a stable home.

3 major things have led me to this. Here they are:

## #1 Kevin

Kevin is one of the most fascinating people I've met. We connected a couple of months ago as mentee and mentor, and we've had some very meaningful conversations.

I admire him not only because of his impressive career—how he went from working as a Product Manager to leading the largest business unit as the General Manager and Senior Vice President in the same company—but also because of his values and the kind of person he is.

During our weekly conversations, one thing we kept coming back to was family. He is not a person who only _says_ that family is important to him, but he has continuously put his family first in all circumstances. As a result, he has been a loving and available husband and father.

When Kevin gets old, what will matter the most is not his career accomplishments, but the fact that he was there for and with his family, always. What will matter is that his family felt loved and cared for.

This is not to say that a good career is not important; Kevin is a remarkably successful person. But this is to say that we should not leave our family behind when pursuing a career goal.

More on the things I've learned from Kevin in an upcoming issue.

## #2 My siblings

My brother and sister have always been there with me, whether it be to celebrate my wins or to be my strength in [difficult times](/blog/on-being-bullied).

My sister has been my annoying but loving best friend through all times. She is a married woman now and has a full-time job as well, but she never forgets to call me almost every other day, or to be there for her family.

My brother has been my best mentor and the strongest catalyst for the life I'm living. I could have never become the person I am today if it hadn't been for the path _he_ paved for me. He is the reason why I went from feeling like a nobody to believing that I could do and become anything I wanted. My brother taught me that it was possible, that anything was possible. And the reason I feel all these things is because he was there with me through everything. Even when he was working 50-60 hours a week, he was there for me and with me, and he still always is.

My brother is not married yet, but I can see the wonderful husband and father he will be.

He is the kind of person I want to become.

## #3 Beautiful families

Earlier this month, I went to the beach for the first time. It was a peaceful time of reflection.

We saw many kids playing, and parents watching their kids play. What made it special was not only the kids and parents, but the entire setting: the waves of the ocean, the blue sky, the gentle breeze, the just-right sunlight, the peacefulness, and the families.

Those are the experiences I want to have with my family. I want my family to not only be loved, but to feel loved. I want to build a family of faith and love.

I will still work towards and achieve incredible things in life, but I will not leave my family behind in that pursuit.

I hope this was helpful in gaining some clarity for yourself.

I will see you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
