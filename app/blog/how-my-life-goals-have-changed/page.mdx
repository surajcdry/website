# How my life goals have changed






Dear reader,

When I was a high schooler, I wanted to achieve what society normally regards as success. In fact, I wanted to go beyond that. I wanted to create an impact at scale; I wanted to change people’s lives, give them jobs, build schools, and factories. I guess many of us might have had similar goals.

But as I’ve grown up, my life goals have evolved. My goals might still continue to evolve, but this is where I’m at right now. I am confident to claim that this isn’t simply me getting influenced, but I genuinely believe that goals don’t need to be so grand. It would be good if I were able to create such an impact, but I don’t think that needs to be what I set out to achieve.

I have evolved to want to become more of a common man. I want to build a family, a home. I want to be able to spend time with my wife and kids, whoever they will be. I want to spend time in prayer and be involved in my community. I want to travel with my family, do things with them, but most importantly, I want to be available in their lives.

My over-confident self says that I will do that and other incredible things in general, but I will not force myself for it. If it’s God’s will, it will be. I will have faith and live today with the best I’ve got. Tomorrow will take care of itself.

A part of this change has also been my growing faith in eternal life in God’s kingdom. In a way, when you truly think about it (with faith), worldly success doesn’t really make that much of a difference, because you aren’t going to take these things after your time here has passed.

This is not to say that it is not worth working hard, because it indeed is. I still need to be able to provide for my family and be a good steward.

I believe God has plans for all of us. If we believe, have faith, and trust in Him to guide us, he will show us the way. He will reveal to us the plans that he has.

This newsletter is not just about things that I’m learning in terms of career, but about living an intentional life altogether, and this growth is a part of that intentional, deep life.

I appreciate you being here. I’ll see you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
