# You Can't Help Them






Hi friend,

How often do you give advice to people?

How often do you recommend people to do something? Maybe to start going to the gym, learning a new skill, reading a book, or building a new habit.

And how often do they not take your advice or even try it once?

More often than not, I assume.

I've had a very similar experience, multiple times.

What you have to realize, as I have, is that _you cannot help them_.

You can only show someone the path, you cannot make them walk it.

No amount of great and valuable advice can get people to do something that they don't feel like doing, even if it might help them accomplish everything that they've ever wanted.

And the fact is: Most people don't want to do things, even if it's for their own good. They just aren't thirsty enough.

This is why, a few days ago, I tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stop giving books away to comfortable, satisfied people. Give them to uncomfortable, dissatisfied people. <a href="https://t.co/6hPgFTCkWE">pic.twitter.com/6hPgFTCkWE</a></p>— Suraj Chaudhary (@SurajCdry) <a href="https://twitter.com/SurajCdry/status/1753963621808214166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most people are comfortable with their lives. They'll rather be comfortable and mediocre than push their limit to achieve greatness.

And now, the words that follow may trigger you. So have this with an open mind:

_What if you're one of them?_

What if you're one of those people that don't listen to others mostly because they're comfortable with their lives?

I know I had been one of those people for a long time. My elder brother kept suggesting me to start working on a few projects from years, but I just wouldn't.

Whenever he'd tell me, I'd be like "Yeah, fine." But I'd never even start working on it.

I regret that.

There are so many things that, if only I had taken his advice, could've helped me accomplish several of my goals.

It takes an open mind to recognize and accept when you're the one at the other side.

Here's what I want you to takeaway from this:

**Takeaway:** Don't waste your time on trying to help others because, for the most part, you can't. Recognize and accept when you should be following your own advice.

If you reached the end, good.

Most people give up if they don't get instant dopamine hit. That's a topic for another day.

Tell me in the comments about your experience on trying to help people. I'd appreciate it.

Have a great week ahead!

See you in next week's newsletter!

Warmly,  
Suraj.
