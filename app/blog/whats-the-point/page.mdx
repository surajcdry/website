# What's the point?




I have no idea what I am doing right now, but I wish to write. I have tried writing before, but have never been consistent with it. Several times when I am not doing something that makes me feel like I’m being productive, I feel guilty. The same was the case when I first started reading.

I remember vividly that I was in grade 8 when I first read a book. It was a book that belonged to my class teacher. I was the class representative back then, so I used to collect the copies and lock the classroom’s locker every day before we left. That was where the first book that I read was; in the classroom’s locker. I had been seeing it almost every school day. But one day, I decided to read that book. I found that book so interesting that I completed it in a day. The book was “[Who Moved My Cheese?](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Moved-My-Cheese-Mazing-ebook/dp/B004CR6AM4)”

![Who Moved My Cheese?](/images/blog/whats-the-point/whomovedmycheese-edited-768x1024.webp "Who Moved My Cheese?")

I didn’t read the book for days after I brought it home from school. I had it in my cupboard for several weeks untouched until we got a week’s holiday (I guess it was for the [Holi festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi)). I decided to take it with me when I was leaving for my village. My village was about 3 hours away from the town where I used to study. On the bus, I took the book out and decided to just have a look at what was in there. I didn’t realize when I was almost halfway through the book.

It was a really interesting book with only about 150 pages. I completed the book within a day. They say that reading your first book is hard, but it wasn’t, at all. What was hard, though, was taking the book and reading the first page. Once I was through the first page, I wanted to know more, I wanted to learn more. At that time, I had no idea that books were “fictional” and “non-fictional”. I thought books were simply books, and reading them was good.

After reading my first book, I wanted to read more and so I did. I read a few other books as well, most of them fictional. I read [Bonecrack by Dick Francis](https://www.amazon.com/Bonecrack-Dick-Francis/dp/0425208850), [The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416), [The Best of Me by Nicholas Sparks](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Me-Nicholas-Sparks/dp/0446547638), and a few others. By then, I was very much into fiction and love and romance. But that didn’t last for long. Soon after I reached grade 10, I started feeling guilty for wasting my time.

I would feel that I wasn’t utilizing my time as properly as I could. I wasn’t doing as well at school either, I was an above-average student but academically I didn’t perform to my fullest potential. So I stopped reading fictional books, stopped watching movies, and stopped doing anything else that would make me feel that I was wasting my time. I started volunteering at [Bridge to Literacy](https://www.bridgetoliteracy.com) (an INGO that teaches English to children from underprivileged countries) as a web developer, and I also did fairly well in my grade 10’s board exams.

By grade 11, I had submerged myself in the productivity realm. I wouldn’t watch any movies or series unless I _needed_ to, wouldn’t read any fictional book, wouldn’t be active on social media, my youtube feed was filled with [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/c/aliabdaal), [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/c/Thomasfrank), [Matt D’Avella](https://www.youtube.com/c/MattDAvella), and other productivity gurus. I wanted to be as productive and good at everything as I could.

Then, I came across creators like [Valspire Family](https://www.youtube.com/c/ValspireFamily) and [Nathaniel Drew](https://www.youtube.com/c/nathanieldrewofficial), and I felt like “What’s the point?”. Now, I also wanted to live life the way they did, by actually living it. I wanted to just travel, meet people, document my life, and just enjoy it. Then the guilt hit and I came back to square one. I was back in the productivity realm. I started my own [website](https://www.highapproach.com/), started learning how to code, started reading books, taking notes, and being a ‘good student’ at school.

I did pick up some fictional books to read, but as soon as I’d read the first page, I’d realize that this book was only a fictional book and most probably wasn’t going to help me professionally in life. So I’d stop reading those books. A few months prior to me writing this post, I was at one of my cousin brother’s place and I noticed that he had a few fictional books on his table. I didn’t have my laptop or any non-fictional books with me, so I picked up [11 Minutes by Paulo Coelho](https://www.amazon.com/Eleven-Minutes-Paulo-Coelho-ebook/dp/B004XYX4WU). I read a few pages, it is a beautiful book, the type that plays in your head like a movie as you read it. I didn’t want to stop reading but the guilt took over and I left the book.

Even on my [website](https://www.highapproach.com/), I wanted to just write, about anything and everything I felt like. But I didn’t because of the guilt and also because then it wouldn’t be a niche educational website. So I got this domain ([SurajC.com](/https://www.surajc.com)). Here I want to _just write_ and not get carried away by the design, the SEO, the analytics, and other technical stuff by which we get carried away so easily. I want to document my life here. I want to write about the books I read, the movies I watch, the experiences I have, and I want to write about everything I feel like and whenever I feel like.

Have you ever felt this way? Have you ever had such an experience? What do you think the point of life is?
