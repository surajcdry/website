# On breaks






Dear reader,

My spring semester just ended a few days ago, and before the next semester begins, I have about a month. Although the break has just started, I've realized that a break invites honesty.

This would only be applicable if I'm not mindlessly binging some movie or series or scrolling. When I'm present and have time, a break allows me to see what I'm really up to. [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/) might call it a _deep break_.

During the semester, I didn't really do much.

Well, I did excel in all my classes, led a club to organize multiple events, and taught Mathematics and CS to multiple students at my university as a Peer Tutor. But I didn't really do most of the other things I wanted to do. There was never enough time to go beyond the things that required immediate attention.

It wouldn't be untrue to say that I am trying to do too much, but if only I try, things might happen, no?

Now that my semester has ended, I don't have the excuse of not having enough time anymore.

There are still commitments that I must fulfil, and they require time. But these were present even during the semester. Regardless, the bottom line is that I have time.

My goal for this break is to realign myself with my values, pray, grow stronger in my faith, and perhaps obtain more clarity on certain things. I think this break is also going to be a good time for some deep work. 5 AM study session, maybe?

One thing is for sure: I'm going to get back to certain things and move forward on others.

How this goes is something to see. I'll keep you posted.

I'll see you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj

PS: Oh, also, my 2025 [yearly review](/blog?category=yearly-review) is coming soon. So look out for that. I'll see you soon.
