# How and what to prioritize?






Dear reader,

I hope you are doing good.

In this week's article, I wanted to talk to you about priorities.

Not the "success should be your priority" but "what will give you maximum satisfaction?"

The point that I'm trying to get across will be best explained with a story.

As you may have guessed through my previous articles, I am very mindful about using technology.

Alongside _using_ technology, I want to be able to _build_ incredible things using the tech we have.

That is to say that I want to learn how to build web applications and software.

For that, I'll need to learn how to program full-stack applications.

I also want to build passive sources of income.

The problem was that I was setting the wrong priorities.

As you can see on my calendar down below, previously, I was prioritizing my secret side hustle "Project UBE" over everything else.

Since it was the first thing I did in the morning, it received my full attention.

I would work on my side hustle in the morning and learn MERN stack (languages to build full-stack web applications) at night.

By doing the lessons at night, I was not learning it to the best of my ability.

However, I recently realized that my Project UBE will pay off only in the short term. It might keep making an alright amount in the long run.

But up-skilling myself, and learning to use the tools to build powerful, scalable applications is what will give me the most return.

Learning the MERN stack is what will allow me to get an internship, work at an amazing company, start my startup, and perhaps make a crazy amount of money.

So I changed a few things on my calendar.

I made taking MERN stack lessons the first thing I did in the morning and also blocked some time during the evening to take a few lessons.

This action was also motivated by a friend of mine, Prince. We inspire each other from time to time.

Anyway, the point that I'm trying to get across is that you should spend the majority of your focused time, i.e. your deep work session, on the things that will drive maximum returns in the long run.

Again, remember that it will seem difficult, you will want to not work on it for several days. But ultimately this is what will help you reach your full potential.

_The obstacle is the way._

It is when things are difficult and you struggle that you know you're learning new things, and making progress.

Keep at it my friend, your future self will thank you.

Here's what I want you to learn from this article:

**Takeaway:** Your priorities are reflected not by your words and dreams but by your actions. Identify what will help you make the most progress towards your ambitions and give that your maximum focused time.

**This week's question for you:** What action should you prioritize? What action will take you towards your dream life?

Write me a quick article response with your answer.

## In case you missed it

Last week, I wrote about building a deep and more fulfilled life. I shared multiple principles for living a deeper personal and professional life.
