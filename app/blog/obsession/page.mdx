# Obsession






Hey reader, [Suraj](/https://www.surajc.com) here –

I recently realized that I have, for the most part, been a man full of words.

I believe in my potential, I speak of it, I talk about all the incredible things I'm going to do and build and accomplish, but I don't have anything to show for it. It is not to say that I'm not working towards those goals. I am, but I am in a "between worlds."

There is something that I _used to be_ and something that I _want to be_, but there is this _Gray Area_ in between the two. This gray area is the phase when I'm not as good or as skilled as I need to be to associate myself with it, but I also don't want to go back to being who I used to be because I want to be more than that. And the Gray Area is a very murky land.

This gray area is where I think I'm at. Perhaps many of us are. This is the phase of feeling lost, of changing friend circles, of figuring out the kind of life you want to build, and of navigating out of it.

## But how to get out of the Gray Area?

I think _obsession_ is the answer.

For the longest time, I have focused on building a balanced, intentional, and [deep life](/blog/build-a-deep-life). The goal was not to be so focused on goals that we leave other things behind. While that is so very important, I've realized that it is easy to overdo.

How does one even know if they are prioritizing balance, or just being lazy because whatever needs doing is hard?

There's a very thin line between the two.

In the future, I might call myself out for being very wrong, but at this point in life, I think early in my career is not the time to focus on balance.

I think the first decade of your career (20s) should be focused on obsessing over things you're passionate about. We should work on learning things, on [doing hard things](/blog/doing-hard-things), and obsessing over mastery. Yes, mastery might never be achieved because as we learn more, we realize how much more we still don't know. But I think we should strive for it.

I think that's the way to get out of the Gray Area:

> Be so good they can't ignore you.

I hope you found this somewhat interesting, perhaps this gave you something to think about over the weekend.

I'll see you next week, hopefully, with ideas that are more fleshed out than this.

Take care!

Warmly,  
Suraj
