# You Need to Stop Learning






“A median person is more interested in **productivity hacks** rather than actually making meaningful progress towards their **productivity/goals.**”

Hey friends,

This week's issue of the newsletter is going to be short but important.

I was recently talking to a friend about how we have collected so much knowledge but haven't really utilized most of that in real life.

The conclusion we came to was: _We Need to Stop Learning_

Let me explain.

More often than not, we already know what to do.

For example, I know very well that if I want should write more content if I want to grow my blogging business but I rarely do that.

I am more likely to instead watch videos on "How to increase your website traffic" or "How to increase backlinks" and so on.

Basically, people (including me) tend to spend more time just learning stuff, instead of actually doing it.

Why?

Because it's easy.

It's very easy to watch a detailed video on how to do something, even if you already know what you need to know to get started, instead of actually doing If I just keep watching videos on how to grow my blog, it won't grow even a bit.

I might feel that I am being productive, but nothing will really change in the metrics of the website unless I write articles, or cold email people for backlinks.

**The takeaway:** We should be more action oriented. action-oriented keep learning. But we should recognize when we have enough knowledge to start. And once we know it, we should begin the work.
