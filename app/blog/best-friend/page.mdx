# Best friend






Hey readers, [Suraj](/https://www.surajc.com) here–

This week, I wanted to share with you an observation about friendship. Let's begin.

Let's imagine that one of your closest friends is going through a tough time. This tough time doesn't necessarily have to be related to goals or career; it can be related to anything. Maybe it's personal, related to family, or related to a struggle about the self.

If that was the case, if this closest friend of yours, whom you knew and understood so well, who was very important to you, if s/he was going through a difficult time in life, how would you encourage them?

Now imagine:

> That close friend is _yourself_.

You literally are your best friend. You have spent the most time with yourself; you know things about yourself that nobody else does, so you understand yourself. The interesting thing, also, is that regardless of what happens, what phase of life you're in, you will always be with yourself.

> So, how would you encourage/support/guide your _best friend_?

When the lows of life come, we are often unable to step back and look at our situation with objectivity and grace. Thinking about your situation in third person, as your best friend, can give an interesting insight, and perhaps some much-needed support.

Take some time to reflect on this. I, my friend, will see you next week.

Take care of yourself, and take care of your best friend.

Warmly,  
Suraj
