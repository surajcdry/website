# Random acts of gratitude






Dear reader,

There's always a person we've wanted to catch up with for a long time but just don't be able to.

Something always comes up, or you get busy, and then you forget.

How would you feel if that person called you out of the blue, not for work but to simply talk to you?

It would be nice, don't you think?

This happened to me a few days back when an old friend called me.

I had been thinking about talking to her for many days but something always came up when that was on my mind.

It was such a nice gesture that she called, simply to talk.

So, here's what I propose:

#1

Take a few minutes once or a few times a week to randomly call your friends or family. Not text. Call. Text doesn't have the same level of good feeling as compared to a call.

#2

One additional thing I suggest you give a try is sending gratitude messages to people you admire.

It could be a friend, a mentor, an author, a creator, an inventor, a teacher, or literally anyone you admire.

This could be as simple as:

> _Hi Cliff,_  
>   
> _I wanted to write this quick email to tell you "Thank you for creating_ [_Speechify_](https://speechify.com/?source=fb-for-mobile&via=suraj)_!"_  
>   
> _Your app has helped me immensely. I have been able to read more books in one month than I was able to read in the entire last year._  
>   
> _Keep doing the great work. Have a great week ahead!_  
>   
> _Warmly,_  
> _Suraj_

These emails may or may not get a response but if the receiver reads these emails, they will probably feel really good.

They might as well respond.

I have gotten responses to such emails from some people at the top of their field.

Also, if this is for a friend or someone who lives in close proximity to where you live, you can ask if they'd like to join you for a coffee or something.

These calls and emails can:

1. Strengthen your friendships

3. Help you build new relationships

5. Bring you incredible career opportunities

I started doing this around 14 months ago when I also [shared it in one of these articles](/blog/procrastinate-to-win).

So, here's what I want you to take away from this article:

**Takeaway:** Sometimes, call your friends randomly, simply to talk. They will feel really nice and so will you. Send gratitude emails to people you admire. Increase your chances of getting lucky.

**This week's question for you:** Is there someone you're losing touch with but you'd like it if you didn't? If so, are YOU taking any initiatives to make things better?

I will write again next week.

Until then, take care.

Warmly,  
Suraj
