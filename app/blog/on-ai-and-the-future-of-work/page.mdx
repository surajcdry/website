# On AI and the future of work






Hi reader, [Suraj](/https://www.surajc.com) here –

It is no news that in the past couple of years, artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly, and it is continuing to do so. If you are reading this, I can say for certain that you have used AI in some shape or form.

**The point is:** AI is getting good at an unprecedented speed, and it, in fact, is going to replace a lot of white-collar jobs.

Since middle school, I wanted to pursue computer science (CS) as a degree, primarily, so that I could build things. But as AI advances, I may not need a CS degree to do that.

This is not to say that I'm quitting my degree or changing pathways; this is just to highlight the fact that companies are [pulling back on hiring](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/us/politics/jobs-report-us-economy.html). And truth be told, if both can get the work done, using AI is a lot cheaper than hiring a person.

Yes, hiring a person is an investment for an organization, which could be very beneficial in the long run, but when uncertainties such as tariffs are in the picture, the first thing companies do is reduce investment (including hiring freezes or posting [ghost jobs](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/ghost-jobs-why-fake-job-listings-are-on-the-rise.html)), and mass layoffs. In 2024, [95,000+ workers were laid off in tech](https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs/) alone.

If this is to continue, where does it leave the people who are just about to enter the job market, including me?

Turns out, it is now more important than ever to focus on skills that go beyond a technical expertise, such as programming or accounting or design, or writing. Maybe not immediately, but as AI advances, which it will, most of these skills will not be enough to make a living. What will remain valuable, however, are the things that include human interaction. It could be a wide range of things, including career paths such as teaching or medicine or blue-collar, but also it could be the skill of talking to people, of negotiating and selling, of leading a team, perhaps even of taking an initiative to launch a side-hustle or a startup.

I could, very easily, just ignore this and keep on with pursuing only a hard skill and my university degree, but if I do not pay attention to this shift in the economy right now, I might be left behind, as will others who choose to ignore this.

So, here are a few things we can do to stay relevant in the years ahead:

1. Be **_outstanding_** at what you do. Mediocrity will not cut it. It might for a while, but not for long.

3. Learn to **talk to and connect** with people. Despite everything, humans will continue to crave human interaction. Those who are good at it will have an upper hand.

5. **Skill stack**. Learn a combination of different skills. Be strategic about it. If possible, make it complimentary. This will not only give you a different perspective on things, but also it will make you more valuable and rare. For example, a lawyer who knows a lot about businesses. More on this in a future issue.

7. Start a **side-hustle**. There is a slight chance that we might have to change our career trajectory later in life. A side-hustle will help us attain more skills and enhance the existing ones. In the worst case, if we have something to fall back on, it'll be immensely helpful. Also, who knows, our side hustles might become our main thing, or they might help us reach financial freedom. It is easier to [steer a moving ship](/blog/the-stationary-ship). Or, if you're a builder, maybe finally launch that startup/business you've been thinking about?

This is an ever-evolving topic, and things will probably change in a few years. But beginning to focus on these things from now will set us up for a better future.

I would love to know your thoughts on this topic. As always, the best way to reach me is to respond to this email.

I will catch you next week. Take care.

Warmly,  
Suraj
