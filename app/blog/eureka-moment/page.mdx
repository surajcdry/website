# Eureka moment






Dear reader,

"I get my best ideas when I'm in the shower" is a very common experience. I've had similar experiences, but in my case, these eureka moments usually occur when I'm either commuting or cooking. Why is that, though? And, is there a way to take advantage of such a thing to maximize quality work? Turns out there indeed is.

When we are doing something that isn't cognitively demanding, our mind is able to subconsciously work on ideas/problems that we are actively working on. These eureka moments might give you an idea, an insight, a solution, or a new perspective to approach something.

The takeaway here is that maybe this can be leveraged by involving such activities between work sets. For example, if you're working on a paper but are stuck, you can start working on something that is less cognitively demanding, such as folding your laundry or doing the dishes.

I hope this gives you something to think about over the weekend.

I will see you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
