# How to get unstuck?






Dear reader,

I will admit that I don't know the answer to that "how to get unstuck" question. However, there is one thing that pretty much always helps. It is simply doing "something", i.e., anything.

It is not uncommon to get stuck or to not feel inspired or motivated to do anything. I was stuck for almost the entire day today. I had about an hour to schedule this newsletter, but even though I sat with a blank document for about 2 hours, I didn't have anything useful. I felt stuck. Then I thought "What if I just write whatever is in my head even though I don't use any of it?"

And yeah, that's about what I did. I kept writing things like "I don't know what I'm doing. I have a deadline for this issue and …." and so on. After a few paragraphs of rambling, I got the idea to write about what I was dealing with (getting stuck). When you just begin doing something, you build momentum, and your chances of getting unstuck increase.

The good bonus is that momentum also builds inspiration. In my case, I was initially not inspired to write because I didn't have an idea that I thought was worthy of sharing. But when I had this particular idea that you're reading, I felt better about it because it helped me feel like I'm progressing. So I am able to write this. It's similar in other cases, too. It is best to do something related to what you're stuck or struggling with.

One way of doing this could be by breaking down your big project into modules or smaller parts and working on those smaller parts, maybe even starting with the easiest of those modules. Simply getting something done helps you get more done.

I will see you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
