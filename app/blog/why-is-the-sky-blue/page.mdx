# Why is the sky blue?






Dear reader,

This past week has been intense; a lot has been going on at the same time. And even though I don't want to admit it, I haven't been giving everything my best.

My calendar is almost entirely full, and I haven't been able to keep up with tasks, family, or friends. I haven't been able to wake up as early as I normally would, and neither have I been able to go to the gym every day.

Often, on such days (or weeks), I'd try to just grind through it even though I knew I was not feeling good. But this time, I've decided to slow down just a little. By that, I don't mean that I won't do the things that I'm supposed to do. I will still complete my assignments, attend the meetings that I must, or write this newsletter, which is important to me.

What I mean is during the times when I am low and not actively doing something, I will let myself take some rest. The most important detail for this period of rest is to let myself _be_, i.e., give myself time to just breathe, think, look outside, or take a walk, not "rest" using my phone or laptop.

While procrastinating to write this issue, I was using my phone, and then I thought, "Maybe, just maybe, if I don't use my phone right now, I might be able to come up with an idea for this week's issue."

The first thing I thought was that I could not fail to deliver some value in this newsletter, and I cannot appear weak or struggling either. The second thing I thought was, "Why not? This is the reality. I am not perfect, I don't have all the answers, and I, like everyone else, struggle."

If I don't admit that I don't know why the sky is blue, how will I ever learn? If I don't accept that I'm struggling, how will I allow myself to slow down to recharge?

So that's what I'm doing right now. There's a very good chance that when you receive this email, I'll be on a walk. I'm about to head out for a while. I won't use my phone or put on my AirPods.

I will just _be_.

I hope this will prompt you to give yourself some time when you need it. Slowing down is not stopping.

I'll see you next week.

Take care, my friend!

Warmly,  
Suraj
