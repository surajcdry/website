# Tribe






Hi Reader, [Suraj](/https://www.surajc.com) here —

It is currently finals week at my university, so I've been studying a lot.

While reviewing the material for my Psychology class, I relearned how having a good social circle significantly reduces the chances of developing multiple major diseases.

The reason I'm talking about it right now is because, obviously, I went slightly deeper. Turns out people from Western countries, or well-to-do societies in general, are significantly more likely to develop depression. This is not something I'm saying, this has been [studied](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4100461/).

Though there are multiple variables, something stands out. It is the idea of a "Tribe." Even though we were smart, the reason we survived on Earth while so many other species didn't is because we stuck together, because we built our tribes and held onto them.

As society advanced with safety and security, agriculture, industry, science, and technology, people realized that they could make more individualistic choices about their lives. Affluence became prevalent.

Poor people have less, so they are forced to share their time and resources in order to survive. Sharing brings them closer; they have a community that cares about them. If we were to just consider global economics, people in Eastern countries don't have to sleep in a different room when they are small, and they don't have to move out once they are 18.

I've been in the US for about 10 months now, and it's not surprising that I don't know the people who live in the same house as you. Everyone is busy in their own lives.

Interestingly enough, now is the only time in human history, I think, when you can live surrounded by people, yet only meet strangers. I picture a big house with a big lawn that separates it from other houses as I write this. We don't connect with people on the same level as we used to.

In a individualist western society, there's not really a tribe. If there is one, it's often a church community, a rebillious group, a gang, a party, or a cult. Even then, it is mostly for individual gains.

I know I went all over the place with this one, but this was something I had been thinking about recently. This is what I think right now based on the information I have, which means I may be totally incorrect with my assumption.

I'd love to get your opinion on this.

I will see you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
