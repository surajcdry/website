# What's the worst that can happen?






Dear reader,

In this week's issue, I am sharing with you my fear and a very important lesson that it taught me.

I have been scared of ferris wheel since I was a child.

When the wheel would go up, it would be alright, but it's when it would come down that I would get scared.

The free fall would feel like my soul is up in the air but my body is being pulled down. I had always been scared of that feeling.

So, I decided to do it again.

I had been thinking a lot about this recently, "what is the worst that can happen?"

Yes, there is a chance that the machine fails and I get into an accident but the chances of that happening is very very low, [1 in 9 million](https://www.observationwheeldirectory.com/ferriswheelarticles/ferris-wheel-accidents/#:~:text=amusement%20parks%20are-,1%20in%209%20million,-as%20safety%20is) according to the data.

I'm more likely to get into an accident on the way to the ferris wheel than when I'm on the wheel.

So the worst thing that can happen is I start crying and embarrass myself, so what? I'm not going to die.

That's why I went on the ferris wheel again.

And guess what? I didn't die.

Here's the thing I've learnt and would like to share with you: 👇🏻

When you're worried to start something, ask yourself _"what is the worst that can happen?"_

If you won't die and if it doesn't cause harm to others, do it.

What is the worst that can happen if you start that side hustle or that YouTube channel?

The regret of failing is less severe than the regret of not trying.

**Takeaway:** For everything you've delayed because you're afraid it might not work out, ask yourself "what is the worst that can happen?" If you or someone else won't die, do it.

**Question for you:** Have you every not tried something because you're afraid about the consequences? If so, what?

I would really appreciate you dropping your answers in the comments.

See you next week!

Warmly,

Suraj
