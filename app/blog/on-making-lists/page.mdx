# On making lists






Dear reader,

This week, I want to introduce you to a powerful yet simple tool that has transformed my productivity: making lists.

I create lists for everything imaginable—names, ideas, websites, books, and more. The key benefit is that it helps me remember and organize my thoughts effectively.

Here’s how I leverage lists:

A major reason I’ve been able to send you these weekly emails consistently for a year is my idea list. It serves as a treasure trove of inspiration, allowing me to revisit and develop previous ideas when I’m at a loss for words.

When meeting new people, I jot down their names in my notes app. Although I rarely need this information, it has proven invaluable on several occasions, saving me from awkward situations.

As someone still learning the ropes of software development, I maintain a list of “App Ideas.” This helps me capture all the innovative concepts I want to explore and build when the opportunity arises.

I also have lists for post-job activities, books I want to read, and those I’ve already completed. Additionally, I keep a list of things I aspire to own someday.

Essentially, I have a list for everything. I adopted this habit after experiencing the frustration of forgetting brilliant ideas. Now, I ensure that every idea, no matter how fleeting, is documented. This practice allows me to revisit and build upon my past thoughts, making it easier to maintain consistency in my projects.

If you haven’t tried this yet, I encourage you to give it a shot. Next time you have an idea or something that might be useful later, jot it down in your phone’s notes app. Your future self will thank you for it.

Let me know how it goes.

I’ll see you next week!

Warmly,  
Suraj
