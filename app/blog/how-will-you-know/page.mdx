# How will you know?






Dear reader,

I've come to realize that being specific is very important.

Many of us (including me) wish to become successful. We sometimes get a little specific while defining success and say, "Success would mean for me making good money, spending time with my family, and having the freedom to do what I want."

But how much money is good money? $5k/month? $10k/month? $20k/month?

Many ultra-wealthy people have admitted that not having a specific financial goal led them to continuously seek more. That came at the cost of losing important people, time with family, and mental health.

Specifics are important not only for our finances but also for our general life goals. Because if you don't have a specifics of a goal in mind, you will:

1. Probably never get around to starting it.

3. Have no idea if you're headed the right way.

5. Not know when you've reached.

A super benefit of having the specifics of a goal is that it makes them achievable. Simply saying, "I want to get fit," won't do any good. It will just be a superficial goal.

How do you want to get fit? By going to the gym? How often do you want to go to the gym? Every day? At what time do you want to go to the gym every day? For how long do you want to work out? What workout plan are you going to use?

Once you figure out those specifics, you will know exactly how you can get fit. You will have a roadmap to reach your goal.

If you take a moment to think about it, or if you try it, you will see how incredibly helpful specifics can be.

I'm working on developing an idea, which I'll share next week. I think you'll enjoy it.

See you next week, my friend.

Warmly,  
Suraj
