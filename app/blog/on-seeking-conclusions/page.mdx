# On seeking conclusions






Dear reader,

I always look for conclusions, in everything.

Regardless of what it is, I second it with a "so what?" My goal is always to only focus on things that make a direct difference in my life. If something doesn't directly affect me, I try to not pay much attention to the matter. But is this really a good approach?

If everything had a conclusion, a point, how would there ever be questions? Without questions, how would there ever be innovation? Innovation not just in science and technology, but also in our lives, our relationships.

Perhaps some questions should remain questions, some dilemmas should remain unsolved.

Still an idea in progress. I'll catch you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
