# This is harder than I thought






Dear reader,

Since the beginning of May, I had stopped working on most of the things that I was working on. An important interview was approaching in a few weeks.

While I could've given it only a week, I decided to give it the entire month, I wanted to prepare to the best of my ability.

The interview went well, and after the interview, I went to be with my parents and relatives for some time because I was about to [move to New York](/blog/i-just-moved-to-new-york) soon.

But all this while, I was not really doing everything that I had been doing prior to the month of May. Yet, I was thinking that once everything got back on track and my schedule became predictable again, I'd just resume doing everything.

Now that I am here in New York City and most of my calendar is free to do the things that I see fit, I'm struggling to get back at things. This is harder than I thought.

I'm struggling to write and shoot YouTube videos. A few days back, I shot a video and deleted it because it just wasn't me. My energy and vibe that I used to have is kind of gone. So I shot the video again, and it's okay I guess. I published it recently, you can watch it by clicking [here](https://youtu.be/pvT7QC6mk08). I'd appreciate it if you could give me some feedback on it.

In the same manner, my capacity to lift weights in the gym has almost reset. The workouts for which I used to use weights of 35-40 kg (77-88 lbs), I'm maxing out at 15 kg (33 lbs). I'm really not feeling like editing videos anymore.

But, there's a line that I'm reminding myself of:  
"This shall pass."

I'm reminding myself that this phase of struggling to get back to my normal routine that I'm proud of, this time will not last forever.

I'm reminding myself that my life is like a storybook. When I'm in one chapter, I won't know what the chapters ahead of this current one hold. All I can do is prepare for it to the best of my ability. And that I will.

I think this is a good time to remind myself and you that:

> **Takeaway:** Sometimes, things don't happen as we expect them to happen. Sometimes, we struggle with things that have become second nature to us in the present. When that "sometimes" happens, do not beat yourself up. Know that you will figure it out, just like you always have. Remind yourself, whenever you need to, that the thing you're struggling with will pass. We've got this, together.

**This week's question for you:** Have you ever struggled with things that you never struggled with before? How did that make you feel?

I'll write again next week.

Until then, take good care of yourself, bud.

Warmly,  
Suraj
