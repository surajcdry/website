# then who even am i?






Dear reader,

Last week I was assigned an essay for my English class. There was no topic, so we could choose whatever we wanted. Perfect!

So I began working on a draft titled “Disconnecting through Connecting.” It was centered around this idea of social media disconnecting us in the name of connecting, and how to change that. It was a pretty basic concept. However, I did write it well and collected a bunch of evidence from books, articles, research papers, and whatnot.

The result? When I met my professor to ask for his suggestions, he pointed out to me that whatever I was writing about was easily agreeable, and very basic. I am using evidence and other elements of a good essay but there is no idea development from my side. Huh…interesting.

I didn’t disagree, because he was right. I did get some ideas to make this essay good, and as of today I’ve already improved it, and (hopefully) might get good grades for it.

More importantly, though, after that conversation with my professor, I began noticing a pattern. I have been writing these newsletters every week since the beginning of the year, but for more than 90% of the issues, I have written about things that have been influenced by others.

The concept of living an intentional life? Meet Cal Newport, the author of Deep Work and Slow Productivity. The idea of constantly working towards something, even if it’s a little bit? Welcome Atomic Habits by James Clear. The idea of building an extraordinary life? Welcome the author of The 4-Hour Work Week, Timothy Ferriss. These influences are too many to list here.

Almost everything I say, think, feel, or create is influenced by someone (people) or something (experiences or sources of knowledge). I think it’s not only _some_ but _all_ of my life that is influenced by external factors. But if that is the case,

> _then who even am i_?

It’s not just me; I argue everything _you_ feel or say or do or think is influenced by others (people and things). So this would mean that everyone and everything is influenced by other things/people.

If that is the case, then what does it even mean to be original? Is originality just a combination of bits and pieces from a multitude of things? Are we all just stealing like artists?

I don’t know. Contemplating these questions surely gave me some identity crises. I don’t have a conclusion for this yet, and I don’t think I ever will.

For now, this is an open conversation between me and you. I would love to know what you think, you can reply to this email.

I will look forward to reading your thoughts about this.

See you next week!

Warmly,  
Suraj
