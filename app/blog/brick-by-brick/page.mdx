# Brick by brick






Dear reader,

Heading into next week, I want to give you 1 interesting idea to think about:

Suppose you are asked to build a wall of 40x40 ft.

If you consider the whole wall, yes it is a lot and probably unattainable unless you give it at least a few full months.

If you think "I'm going to build the biggest, baddest wall anyone has ever seen", you are very unlikely to complete it.

But if you were to focus on laying the individual bricks, if you thought "I'll lay this current brick perfectly, in the best way possible," you will build the wall.

Just focus on laying one brick after another, and in some time, you will have built the biggest, baddest wall.

You should have a long-term outline for what you want to do, but it is the day-to-day actions that make a difference.

When you're driving in the winter with fog ahead of you, your car's headlight only clears the immediate few meters, not the entire road.

Focus on driving that immediate distance properly, on laying the current brick properly, on doing your best on the present day.

> **Takeaway:** Your life is built by the things you do in the present, the decisions you make, and the actions you take. Give your best in the current day. Work towards the goals you have, one day at a time.

**This week's question for you:** How big would you dream if you knew you wouldn't fail, if you knew you couldn't fail?

Thank you for being a part of this community.

I'll write again next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
