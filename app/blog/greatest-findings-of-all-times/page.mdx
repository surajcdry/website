# Greatest findings of all times






Hey friends,

This week I wanted to do something a little different.

Instead of sharing interesting ideas or realizations like I always do, I wanted to share with you some of the sources of those ideas.

Below are some of the videos and podcast episodes that I've found to be incredibly useful and impactful in my own life. If you do check any of these out and find them interesting, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

You can simply respond to this email, that's the best way to get in touch with me.

Let's begin.

### 1\. How to learn anything faster with Cliff Weitzman

Watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfALZJcurZw).

First, this is an excellent interview by Ali Abdaal; he asks almost all the questions that come to my head as I'm listening. Secondly, don't get mistaken by the title. Yes, Cliff does talk about how speed learning can be incredibly powerful (I use it), but this conversation has a lot more value.

One, for example, is how easily we can get in touch with people that seem out of reach. If you want to jump to exactly that part, click [here](https://youtu.be/yfALZJcurZw?t=3764&si=xIGdozdQqYERSjIb). This conversation was also the reason I started sending gratitude letters to people that are important to me. Highly recommended.

### 2\. How to build a world-class network in record time by Tim Ferriss

Watch [here](https://youtu.be/2DNAY5Ulif0?si=cgggQoMvEwF-pDEt).

I have watched/listened to this presentation at least 3 times now. It has some amazing, amazing advice on networking. Here are two of the many things you will learn:

1. Anyone you meet might have the connections to get you on the front page of the New York Times or entirely change your life and fulfill all your dreams. _Don't dismiss people_ thinking they're unimportant.

3. When you're rude, dishonest, or inconsiderate to someone, you immediately lose all the credibility you have in their eyes. Goes with rule #1. _Don't be a dick_.

### 3\. How to launch a million-dollar business this weekend with Noah Kagan

Watch [here](https://youtu.be/_htIvi4JzOs?si=zKKVrRESRZJEV0Bb).

Okay, this is probably the longest episode that I've listened to more than a few times. It's a 4 hour-long conversation. I know that's absurd, but man, the amount of practical and actionable ideas they discuss is absolutely worth it. They talk about a bunch of things, some random, but super practical and powerful—including negotiation, expanding comfort zone, starting a business, specific goal setting, overcoming stagnation, rejection, and much more.

### 4\. How to reinvent your life in 4 months by Cal Newport

Watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G7Wu4DnDaw).

This is the video I've shared with a lot of my friends and for good reasons. If you don't know, Cal is the author of Deep Work and a few other equally amazing books. What I admire about him most, though, is how intentional he is with everything he does.

In this episode, he dives deep (lol) into some of the integral parts to build a fulfilling life. I won't give you any spoilers here because I think it'll be much better if you hear from him directly.

That's all for this week. This is something new I'm trying. If you'd like me to share such resources often, let me know via a reply.

Anyway, I'll see you next week.

Take care.

Warmly,  
Suraj
