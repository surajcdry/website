# You should give up






_Quick note: I'm currently traveling, so couldn't record an audio version for this issue. I'll update it on the website once I can record it._

Dear reader

In this week's article, I encourage you to give up on things.

There's a concept called the "sunk-cost fallacy." (Thank you [](prajwalthapa.com.np)[Prajwal](https://www.prajwalthapa.com.np/)[](prajwalthapa.com.np) for telling me about this.)

It is a phenomenon where a person doesn't want to abandon something because they have already invested a lot of time, effort, or money into it, even though abandoning it would clearly be more beneficial.

Very rarely do we realize that something we're doing is not worth it, but more often than not, we still don't stop because we've "already done this much."

Even when you're reading a book but don't like it, you feel guilty about not completing it.

Even when you're juggling a side hustle or a personal project or business and know it's not worth it, you think you should just continue.

Even when you've chosen a major in college or a career path that you don't like, you feel like you should just continue.

Even when you've committed to something or someone and know it's not worth it, you think you have to continue.

I want to remind you that you don't have to.

You can just stop doing the things that you don't like or spending time with the people you don't like.

The transition may be a little rough in some cases, but you will survive.

And at the end of it, you will have to no longer deal with it/them.

Just as "the best time to start that business was 5 years ago and the second best time is now", the best time to stop putting effort into that thing/person was long ago and the second best time is now.

If you don't give up on it now, later in the future you will hope you had given up.

On the other hand, if you do give up on these things and people, you'll be grateful to yourself that you did.

Here's what I want you to learn from this article:

**Takeaway:** For the things and people you know aren't worth it but you have already done so much, just give up now. Don't waste your time or energy on those things or people.

**This week's question for you:** What is one thing you've committed to but wish you didn't have to do anymore?

I'll write again next week.

Until then, take care.

Warmly,  
Suraj
