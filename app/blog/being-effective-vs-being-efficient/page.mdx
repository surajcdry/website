# Being effective vs being efficient






Dear reader,

Since I sent out [last week's issue](/blog/shifting-priorities), I've been reflecting on the closing line:

> "We should be _effective_, not _efficient_."

I thought it would be helpful to elaborate on this.

Being "efficient" equates to being productive; it means you're doing things well. However, it overlooks whether those actions are genuinely useful or important.

In contrast, being "effective" focuses less on productivity and more on accomplishing the right tasks—those that are significant and impactful for your goals.

When starting out, it's rewarding to feel efficient. It’s satisfying to juggle many tasks with the hope that something will succeed. Yet, as you become more aware of your goals, you realize that only a few key actions are needed to achieve them.

By concentrating on fewer, pivotal tasks, you can make much more progress toward your ideal life than if you attempt to do countless things by simply being efficient.

So, as you prepare for the weekend, pause to consider where you're being efficient and how you can shift toward being more effective. Identify the most crucial tasks that will yield the greatest return on your time and effort, and prioritize those.

I wish you a fantastic weekend!

See you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
