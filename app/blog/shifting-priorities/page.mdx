# Shifting priorities






Dear reader,

So, I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting lately, and I realized that I’ve been a bit off track from my goals for last year. I was feeling a bit guilty about it, thinking I was just being lazy. But then I took a closer look at my schedule, and I realized that even thought I’ve been [taking proper rests](/blog/why-is-the-sky-blue) from time to time, I've primarily been focusing on the things that really matter to me at this particular point in time.

It wasn’t me being lazy, it was just my priorities shifting. Last year, when I was setting [my goals for 2024](/2023-review/#:~:text=even%20some%20pushups.-,2024%20Goals,-I%20would%E2%80%99ve%20added), I didn’t know what I didn’t know. This year has been a wild ride, with a lot of significant moves. I moved to the US for my undergrad, got more focused on my career, and much more.

I feel like the current me knows a lot more than my previous self. While it’s sad that I don’t do a lot of the things that my old self would’ve loved to do, I think it’s okay. I have to allow myself to grow and adapt and, most importantly, change a little when needed.

Life happens, and sometimes it demands things different from what we would’ve wanted. It’s important to recognize what’s going on and have the courage to forgive ourselves during these times.

There’s still about a month remaining for 2024 to come to an end. I don’t know what might change in that time, but I’m excited to see where it takes me.

Perhaps you've been having your own wild ride. I hope this is able to help you feel not so bad about it. It's okay to forgive yourself.

We should be trying to be _effective_, not _efficient_.

See you next week!

Warmly,  
Suraj
