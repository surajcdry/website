# Systemize your relationships






Dear reader,

I have two siblings: a brother and a sister. All three of us live in different places. All three of us are busy with our own lives, studying and working.

Previously, once every or every other month, we used to have a video call where we caught up with one another's lives.

When we used to talk, almost every time, we used to be like "we should talk more often, this feels nice." But we never really did anything about it.

About 3 months back, however, I scheduled a group call once every week. Later we had to make it once every other week. While this is not super often, we have been able to talk regularly since starting this scheduled call. This is so much better than talking once a month or every other month.

It's a similar case in some of my friendships, I talk to them on an almost regular basis. This is something that I'm still working on, and I'd love it if you joined me on this journey.

Let's do this:

1. Make a list of the people we want to be in touch with.

3. Create weekly or biweekly blocks of time to talk to them, not text but either active video call conversation or in-person meeting.

Pro tip: Make a list of cafés, restaurants, or places you want to go to and ask them to join. This way you'll get to go to the place and you'll be able to catch up with your friends too.

Okay, I'll acknowledge that there will be people who will be against _scheduling_ our relationships. But trust me, if you keep your relationships for "when the time is right" or impulse or fate, most of your relationships will fade into void.

It has happened with me and I am confident that being intentional with our friendships, family, and relationships will make them stronger.

> **Takeaway:** Be intentional with your relationships. Take the initiative to talk and spend time with the people you admire, love, and want to remain in touch with.

In case you decide to try this, let me know how it goes.

**This week's question for you:** Have you ever lost a person you loved mostly because neither of you took the initiative to talk or spend more time with each other while at the same time hoped the other person would do it?

It feels really nice to write to you, my friend.

I hope you have a wonderful weekend.

See you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
