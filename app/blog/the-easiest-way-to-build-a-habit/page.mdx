# The Easiest Way to Build a Habit






Dear reader,

This week's article will be short because I'll head right to the point.

As you may know through my article on [building a superpower](/blog/this-is-a-superpower), I read a ton of books.

So, a couple of weeks ago, I thought "Why don't I take a bunch of notes when I'm reading and publish them as book notes on my website?"

At that time I was reading a book called "Authority: Become an Expert, Build a Following, and Gain Financial Independence" by Nathan Barry who is also the founder of the $38 million company ConvertKit.

So I did. I published this [Authority (Nathan Barry) – Book Notes](/blog/authority-book-notes).

However, there was one detail because of which I might not take notes on books anymore.

And it is: _friction_.

Look, the thing is that I don't read books in isolation.

Usually, I listen to audiobooks when I'm taking a walk or when I'm cooking.

So, when I was doing this experiment, whenever I heard something interesting, I'd have to stop doing whatever I was doing, pull out my phone, or get my laptop to take notes.

This was not a good idea because it introduced a lot of friction between me and my reading.

Previously, I used to look forward to reading/listening to books. But during this experiment, I'd be like "Ugh, I don't want to read because I'll have to take notes."

This was a reminder for a principle that I use in everything:

> "_The more the friction, the less likely you will be to do it._"

Over the years, I've realized that whenever I make something complicated, maybe adding layers or multiple steps, more friction is introduced and nothing gets done.

This is the exact opposite of what will take me towards the life I want to build.

## What can you do?

Here's a few ideas:

1. If you want to wake up early, put your phone slightly away from your bed so that you have to get up to turn off the alarm. Keep a hot water dispenser or your coffee machine right beside your phone. That way it'll be almost effortless for you to drink some lukewarm water or have coffee in the morning to wake yourself up.  
    

3. Want to build a reading habit? Keep a book on your bed. Don't take your phone to bed. So whenever you go to your bed to sleep, you'll see the book and will feel like "Okay, let's read a bit." Boom! Goal accomplished.  
    

5. Want to build a journaling habit? Don't look for systems and pretty design for journaling. Start by simply writing down what you did during the day, what you're feeling, or whatever is bothering you in your notes app. Least friction.

Here's what I want you to take away from this article:

**Takeaway:** The more the friction, the less likely you'll be to do it. So reduce friction in the things you want to do, and habits that you want to build.

**This week's question for you:** How do you build new habits? What approach do you take?

Drop a comment down below to let me know you read to the end.

Appreciate you being here.

I'll write again next week.

See you!

Warmly,  
Suraj
