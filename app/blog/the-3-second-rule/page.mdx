# The 3-second rule






Dear reader,

Remember, our minds are wired to avoid discomfort.

When we’re lying on the bed or sofa, contemplating a task we’ve been procrastinating on, our minds start suggesting alternative, less uncomfortable options like eating, watching a YouTube video, or taking a break. However, we all agree that the most important tasks for building a fulfilling life are often challenging.

So, how can we bridge the gap between our goals and our comfort-seeking minds? The key lies in time. The gap between our thoughts of doing something and actually doing it is our target. The longer we delay, the more friction we create because our minds generate more reasons or options to avoid or skip the task. So, once you decide to do something, start taking action within the first three seconds.

Let’s consider an example. Sometimes, we see someone well-dressed and feel compelled to compliment them. But our comfort-seeking mind intervenes, telling us we’d bother them or they’re busy. This often leads us to avoid the compliment altogether. Of course, there are exceptions, but they’re rare.

Frequently, the excuse “it’ll bother someone” is just a way to avoid the uncomfortable task.

So, the next time you have a pending task or something you want to do and know you should do it, just start. Don’t overthink it. Once you begin, you’ll realize it’s not as bad as you imagined. It’s similar to how we feel nervous before presenting in front of a large audience. We’re super nervous initially, but we become comfortable once we’re in the flow.

To challenge yourself and try some “discomfort exercises,” consider these:

1. Compliment the people you meet this weekend.

3. When ordering coffee, ask for a 10% discount.

In the first exercise, the other person might simply say “thank you.” However, in the second exercise, they could decline your request. This slight variation in response makes the second exercise slightly more challenging, as it introduces the possibility of rejection.

But here’s a crucial question to ask yourself: [What is th](/blog/worst-that-can-happen)[e worst that could possibly happen?](/blog/worst-that-can-happen)

When you compliment someone or ask for a discount, the worst they can say is “no.” Similarly, when you undertake a challenging task, the worst that can happen is that you might learn something valuable even if you fail. So, why not embrace the discomfort and take action?

The next time you find yourself hesitating about doing something, remember the 3-second rule: just start.

I look forward to seeing you next week.

Take care!

Warmly,  
Suraj
