# I used AI as a Palmist






Hi reader, [Suraj](/https://www.surajc.com) here –

This week, I wanted to share with you something fun I did recently.

So, a few days ago, one of my cousins asked us to try using ChatGPT as a palmist. He also sent us a prompt to use. So, almost 7-8 of us tried it, and it turned out to be surprisingly (over 90%) accurate for all of us, not just one.

Now, one could argue that the AI model may be using our chat history to draw those conclusions, so we tested it. We sent palms of different people to someone else's accounts. It was still accurate. We also tried unused palm images to test if it was just syncing the knowledge within its servers, but it was still accurate.

A few days later, a friend and I got on a call and started asking more questions to dig deeper and check what the AI model says. That was very interesting.

So if you'd like to try, here are the (slightly refined) prompts we used:

**A few heads-up:**

1. When you take the photo of your palm, make sure it's against a plain background and your palms are clearly visible.

3. You don't have to believe that everything is written when we are born, I don't believe it either. But it's interesting, nonetheless, to see what can be hypothesized from it.

5. An AI model is trained on countless resources and books, including books on palmistry. Those same books are used by people who pursue palmistry professionally. So it is based on datasets, not demonic energy.

7. The assumptions an AI makes can be almost entirely inaccurate. Don't rely on it. You are the one who gets to decide what you do and what you don't do.

9. This is purely for entertainment purposes.

**Prompt #0:** Add the image of your hands, and send it with prompt #1.

**Prompt #1:**

_Hi, I’d like to get a palm reading done that gives me deep clarity on:  
  
\- My life path and destiny  
\- My career and wealth future  
\- My love/relationship timeline  
\- My health and long-term energy  
\- Any breakthrough or spiritual patterns written in my palms  
  
Here are clear images of both my palms (left and right), taken naturally without strain.  
  
Please read them carefully and give me a detailed breakdown, especially on the major signs, lines (life, heart, head, fate, sun), and any special marks you see.  
  
I want a calm, pure, accurate reading, nothing generic.  
  
Let me know what’s written in my palms about my success, health, relationships, and emotional journey._

**Prompt #2:**

_Could you please tell me about any career forks, along with timing breakdowns of major life events/phases? Please be specific._

If you try it and find something interesting, let me know. I'd love to hear about it.

I will see you next week.

Warmly,  
Suraj
