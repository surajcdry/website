# Impulse






Dear reader,

All of us have certain quirks. Some of those quirks we are willing to accept, and others we are not. My being impulsive is the latter, or at least it's something that I haven’t accepted so far. Now, however, it is time that I do so.

I am impulsive. It isn’t just one thing that I’m impulsive at, either. I make most of my plans for going out at the last moment. My best friends can attest to that. Most times, I’ve just shown up at their houses and had them go out with me, sometimes for a couple of days at once. Remember how I [mentioned](/blog/in-search-of-god) that I’ve gone to Lumbini multiple times? Most of those times were spontaneous.

These impulsive experiences have often been rewarding in terms of the people I’ve met and the memories I’ve collected. Living alone from a young age definitely has had something to do with this freedom.

But this spontaneity also has a not-so-great side to it—I sometimes make purchases and investments on an impulse. So far, these decisions haven’t caused any damage since, if need be, they have always been easily reversible, but certainly, this won’t always be the case. To be honest, I didn't realize this on my own; a close friend pointed it out to me. For a moment, I couldn't believe it. I became defensive and began attempting to explain my decisions. In a while, however, I realized that I was just making excuses.

Now, I don't know a way to fix this immediately, but I have an idea which might help: Whenever I want to do/invest/get something, I will keep it on a "maybe list" for a week. After a week, if I still think that it will truly be useful and is a sound resource investment, only then will I move forward with it. I have a couple of things on my maybe list. Even though I have the urge to get it done ASAP, I am going to hold on. I will wait for a week and then decide if I should still move forward with it.

I'll let you know if something interesting happens. I'll see you next week.

Until then, take care.

Warmly,  
Suraj
