# Believing in the Sun






Hello, hello, reader. [Suraj](/https://www.surajc.com) here —

On the day I'm writing this, the weather is gloomy. So this issue of the Figuring Things Out newsletter is brought to you by this gloomy weather. In this issue, I'm going to share with you a lesson that I hold very close to my heart, along with a poem to accompany it.

Let's begin.

Over time, I've noticed a persistent pattern in myself. I remain hopeful about certain things—well, about a lot of things—even when there seems to be no hope. Yes, I do have my downtime, but this state of being hopeful is more prevalent than absent. This hope may be influenced by my approach of trying to _make things happen_, but a major reason is also that I believe in the sun.

What does it even mean, though, to believe in the sun?

In some sense, our life is comparable to the weather. We have our beautiful sunny and warm days, but we also have our fair share of rainy and gloomy days. But when we are experiencing a gloomy season, we often tend to think that gloominess is all that there is, at least in that season. But this is what I reject.

Regardless of how gloomy a day or a season is, no matter how much it rains, the sun is always there. There could always come dark clouds between you and the sun, but the sun is unswerving. It is a constant, it's always there. Once the clouds pass, which they always do, you'll see the sun again.

The sun is hope. Hope is the sun. Hope is always there, we just have to allow ourselves to accept it.

Now, here is the poem I was talking about:

## a man of purpose

![an old man on a cycle in a field on a gloomy evening](/images/blog/believing-in-the-sun/a-man-of-purpose-819x1024.jpg)

_wrinkled skin,_  
_hunched back-_  
_a hopeful man._  
  
_“there are no bad days,”_  
_he says._  
  
_with a flare in his eyes,_  
_he works._  
_he speaks of justice,_  
_of courage, of hope_.  
  
_he knows:_  
_from earth he has come,_  
_and to earth,_  
_he shall return._  
  
_but that doesn’t bother him;_  
_he believes in the sun._  
  
_clouds and seasons can try,_  
_earth can turn,_  
_but hope remains–_  
_just like the sun._  
  
_neither a nihilist_  
_nor a loner._  
_he is a father,_  
_a man of purpose._  
  
_\- SurajC._

This is it for this issue. I will see you next week. Until then, take care.

Warmly,  
Suraj
