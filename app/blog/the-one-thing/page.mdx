# The one thing






Dear reader,

I don't want to admit it, but I will: I am not very smart.

Last year, when I set my yearly goals for the first time, I created many aspirations. I wanted to grow on all social media platforms, get fit, write a research paper, learn to drive, and much more.

The issue was that my focus was divided among multiple areas, preventing me from going deep into any one of them. I tried to be efficient by wanting to do everything, but I should have aimed for effectiveness instead.

There are often certain actions we can take that make other tasks easier or even irrelevant. For example, my motivation for growing on social media was to build a community, which could have been accomplished by focusing solely on YouTube. However, since I tried to grow on so many platforms, I didn't see much growth on any of them, except for a slight increase on YouTube. This was because I finally recognized where I was headed and adjusted my path accordingly.

One of the biggest lessons from 2024 was to be very careful when deciding on and prioritizing goals. One cannot possibly achieve everything all at once. It is possible to achieve everything, but that will happen one after another, not simultaneously.

So, try to determine what is most important and what will make other tasks easier or irrelevant, and make those your priority.

And if you find it difficult, remember that [this shall pass](/blog/this-shall-pass).

I'll see you next week. Until then, take care!

Warmly,  
Suraj
