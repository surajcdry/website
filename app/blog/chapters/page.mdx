# Chapters






Dear reader,

I don't really share personal matters in this newsletter.

Even today, I won't get into the nitty-gritty of things, but I'm going through a major life event right now—a difficult one.

So I've been pondering multiple questions.

How does one stay hopeful in life? How does one look forward to life even when nothing seems to be working out or when one is just tired of things?

This has led me to tap into an analogy I used to use once upon a time.

I cannot say that it is the best analogy, but it has given me hope when I've needed it the most, and my hope is that it can do the same for you.

> Life is a story book, and phases are chapters.

I truly believe that our lives are like story books, and we live our lives in chapters. When we are in a certain chapter, we have only read the chapters until then.

There is no way for us to know what the chapters ahead hold. It could be bad, but it could also be good; it almost always is good. Who knows that one of the chapters that is yet to come might become the best chapter of your story? It could become the highlight of your life.

Over a year ago, I wrote about adopting the mindset of "[This shall pass](/blog/this-shall-pass)" when dealing with difficult times, projects, or situations.

This _chapters_ metaphor is very similar to that one, but the difference is that while _this-shall-pass_ focuses on the day-to-day, _chapters_ focuses on life as a whole. A "bigger picture approach" would be a good way to put it, perhaps.

Just _knowing_ that there are more chapters in our lives gives us hope. Hope not only to survive through adversity but also to excel and thrive. This hope we must cling to.

I'll see you next week.

Take care!

Warmly,  
Suraj
