# Not a Photo Person






I am NOT much of a _photo person_.

I don't mind people taking photographs every now and then, of all the things they do, food they eat, places they visit. But I don't know why, I don't do so myself. I guess I just am not a photo person.

There are times, however, when I fear that I _might regret it_.

Do I visit places? Yes. Do I sometimes eat not just delicious but also interesting food? Yes. Do I meet really interesting people at times? Yes. Are there moments I want to remember? Hell yes.

But that's the problem.

I fear forgetting. I would like to remember all the interesting memories I have built, all the kind people I've met, all the amazing moments I've had.

I want to remember it all. But what if I forget.

Yes, there are things (and people) that are better forgotten, but there are more of the things that I'd like to remember.

And ultimately, we are a product of everything we've been through, no? Both good and bad. That is why I am trying to build a habit of taking more photos. A few video clips too, of course.

I realized that it doesn't really take much time to take out my phone, take a photo, and put it back in my pocket.

I think 5 or 10 years from now, I will feel good to look back at the old photos of all the places I will have visited, the amazing people I will have met, the beautiful memories I will have created.

I think it will be nice.

Will I remember to take a photo every time something interesting happens or every time I meet someone nice or every time I visit a heavenly place? Of course not.

But I know for sure that I will smile back at the nostalgia that these photos will create.

Maybe you should take more photos as well.

Anyways, I hope you have a great day, my friend. Take care.

Until next time.
