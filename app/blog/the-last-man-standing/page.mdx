# Why you should become \\\






Hey reader,

In this week's article, I wanted to write about a topic that I've been thinking a lot about recently.

It is associated with a simple hack to succeed at anything.

Do you remember COVID and the lockdown?

The entire world was shut down during that time and many people were struggling, but there was something else that was going on.

Since everyone was locked in their houses, lots of people were entering the content creation space, i.e. YouTube, LinkedIn, blogging, and so on.

In a recent interview, Ali Abdaal (the productivity king on YouTube with 5.26M subscribers) was asked if he was worried about so many people starting their YouTube channels in the productivity niche.

He said that he wasn't.

Why? Because he knew 95% of those people would give up before the second month and before their 4th video.

It was true.

Did you know there is a "National Quitters Day" on the second Friday of January (January 12) in America when 80% of people who set new year's resolution give up on them (mostly gym)?

Interesting indeed.

If you study the people who set some goal and work towards it, you'll most likely notice a pattern of them giving up on their goals after not receiving instant results.

Don't we all have a YouTube channel, a Wattpad page, a blog, or a membership that we gave up on?

So why am I saying you all of this?

Because that is where our simple hack to success lies: _**become the last man standing**_.

Here's what you should do to achieve anything:

1. Acknowledge that after the initial burst of motivation, it will get hard and results won't come quickly

3. Once things get hard and boring, remember the "last man standing principle"

5. Hang on for some more time

To succeed, you just have to know that it will take some time for you to see results.

As shared in my [2023 review and goals for 2024](/blog/2023-review) article, I joined gym on January 7. I have been hitting the gym every week regularly.

I haven't seen any major progress in my physique yet.

But I know that if I give up right now, I will 100% not get any results. And if I just hang on, go for some more months, I will begin to notice my body getting into a good shape.

So that's what I'm going to do, I'll hang on.

While most people who joined my gym are giving up and the gym is getting more empty, I'll become _the last man standing_.

**What are you going to become the last man standing at?**

Tell me in the comments.

**Takeaway:** If you simply don't give up when you don't see instant results, you'll be among the top 5% people who achieve their goals.

That's it for this week. Let me know if you found this helpful.

I'll see you next week.

Warmly,

Suraj.
