# On accountability






Dear reader,

I have been writing this newsletter for over two years now. During the same time, there have been other things that I’ve taken up and then given up on. 

I enjoy the feeling of having written, but, more importantly, what has helped me remain so consistent with this newsletter is because of accountability.

This newsletter started with me occasionally sharing ideas in the void of the internet (which nobody read). But then, people started reading my writings. Soon enough, people close to me learned that I write, and they joined the email list. 

As the list grew and I continued to write, two things happened:

1. As people responded, I began to feel like my writing mattered and that people looked forward to it. I did not want to let them down, especially not the people close to me.

3. With every issue that I sent out, I built more proof that _I am a person who shares useful ideas consistently_. 

The second is a perk of the first. Accountability, my friends, can help you do incredible things. It would be unwise not to make full use of it.

You want to get fit? Learn guitar? Sing more? Study more? Pray more? Commit to sharing your journey on Instagram every day or every week. Make simple videos where you just take your phone and give updates. Most people who follow you will appreciate how genuine you are; they will begin to look forward to your progress in your journey. 

If you don’t think you can make videos consistently, maybe start a newsletter, as I’ve done. If you want me to make a guide on how to do so, let me know.

One might make the case that it is not necessary to share the journey publicly, and I understand. In my experience, however, when you commit to something publicly or to people you don’t want to let down, you feel more responsible. This includes both your actions and inactions. 

However you decide to do it, keep in mind to [reduce friction](/blog/the-easiest-way-to-build-a-habit). If you don’t spend some energy on friction management, you might stay disciplined for a few weeks, and then you will go back to your default. That you must avoid.

I will see you next week. Be well, my friends.

Warmly,  
Suraj
