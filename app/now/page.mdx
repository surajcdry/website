## What I'm doing

**Recently, I:**

1. Went to see the NYC Halloween parade. So many people and so many things I wish I hadn't seen, including naked people with full body paint.

3. Figured out how to properly get Java to work in my VS Code setup. It has made my life so much easier. I won't be using the outdated Apache Netbeans anymore.

5. Got a Udemy course to learn something I've been putting off for a while.

**Now, I am:**

1. Learning DSA using Java.

3. Trying to break out of the busy cycle of school and work that is not aligned with what I want to do in the long run.
