Hi, it’s Suraj, thanks for checking out my blog.

I share actionable tips for optimizing life and work every week.

I sometimes also host a podcast. But most people know me for my [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@surajcdry), [newsletter](/), and [articles](/blog) on productivity and building a deeper life.

If you want to get in touch, email me at _suraj@surajc.com_.

## The story behind this website

You can see this site as my record of inspirations, ideas, realizations, and lessons that I have accumulated over time.

If you find something interesting and helpful, it is because of the incredible people I've been fortunate to learn from. If you find something wrong, it is because of me. I hope you'll forgive it.

I started this blog as something on the side where I used to write occasionally, but now I publish one article every week.

My work focuses on three main topics:

1. **Productivity:** How can we achieve more without sacrificing our well-being?

3. **Personal life:** How can we build a deeper and more fulfilling life by improving our habits?

5. **Business/Careers:** How can we find meaning in our work?

Readers have told me they like SurajC.com for these reasons:

- Weekly articles with actionable tips

- My relatable and down-to-earth perspective on the topics I write about

- The wide range of personal topics I cover, from productivity to personal life

- The weekly reminders in their inbox to keep improving themselves

Here’s what one reader, Dennis Miranda, wrote in an email:

> _Hi Suraj,

> I just wanted to let you know that the internet is already full of the type of content you produce, and yet your content is of top quality for me. Out of countless newsletters giving advice on productivity and self-improvement, I’ve found yours to be the most practical. It's encouraging to know that I am not alone in this journey of growth. I wasn't much of an email person, but I look forward to your emails every week. Thank you!_

In around 2019, I felt very stuck in life. I had been struggling to find fulfillment and balance in my life. I knew I wanted to build a good life, but had no idea on how to.

So I started researching and studying everything I could find in this regard. These were articles, books, documentaries, and even movies and YouTube videos.

Most advice was not really helpful, but some were goldmines.

I kept taking notes on everything I was learning. I realized that these notes could help others, too. So, I started this blog in 2021.

This blog is basically a collection of all of those goldmines. Every week, as I continue to learn and grow, I add more to this collection.

Over the years, I have gotten a chance to get to know some of the readers who have subscribed to my newsletter. It's a beautiful feeling when they respond to emails, saying how relatable and helpful my emails have been.

One of the best things about having a blog is that you can connect with people all around the world; I have subscribers from over 17 countries. An estimated 972,000+ people have read at least one of my articles on this blog and other places where I write.

That’s the power of the internet!

**One thing my readers often ask me is where I get my insights from.** I’m an avid reader, and I read every single day. Good non-fiction books are one of the best sources of knowledge, but what I've also found incredibly helpful are personal blogs of the people I admire.

> Books are about ideas that are fully built. Not every idea gets a fair chance to be developed. Personal blogs of thinkers are a collection of all of those ideas. They are a treasure.

If you want to learn from a great mind, simply read the books they have written, books that are written about them, or their blog.

But books and blogs are not my only source of inspiration and wisdom. I’m always curious about learning new skills and ideas. And you can learn from everything and everyone. Learning is what keeps this blog alive.

As long as I’m learning, I’ll keep sharing.
