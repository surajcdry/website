I appreciate that you're here.

Thank you for joining the community.

Welcome to the Figuring Things Out!

I send an email every Friday between 7 PM and 8 PM Eastern.

Here's what you can expect from every email:

- One realization

- One practical takeaway to improve your life

- And one bonus interesting thing (question, article, quote, book, podcast, video)

I hope you will find Figuring Things Out useful!

Warmly,  
Suraj
